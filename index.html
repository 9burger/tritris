            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>
                Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press down to soft
                drop. Use Z and X to rotate.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanics are very similar to NES Tetris. It uses the same
                DAS, entry delay, and level speed timings.<br />
                All of the pieces are made out of 3 connected right triangles.
                There is also a white, single triangle piece which can be used
                to fix holes in your stack. It will always come out 3 at a time.
                The single triangle is also special, lines will only be cleared
                once they have all been placed. This allows you to fill 3 lines
                and score a Tritris!
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Phasing</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most unique mechanics of Tritris is phasing. A piece
                will always move to the next location as long as the next
                location is valid (there are no intersecting triangles).
                By moving a piece in multiple ways at the same time, peices are
                able to many types of tucks and spins. Below are a few examples.
            </p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="gifContainer">
                    <img class="gif" src="assets/down.gif" />
                    <p>
                        The pieces are able to easily move down into an empty
                        space.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="gifContainer">
                    <img class="gif" src="assets/downRotate.gif" />
                    <p>
                        For the first triangle, down and X (rotate) are pressed
                        simultaneously
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="gifContainer">
                    <img class="gif" src="assets/downMove.gif" />
                    <p>
                        Left or right are held when the piece is above the
                        desired position, and when the piece moves down, it also
                        moves horizontally.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="gifContainer">
                    <img class="gif" src="assets/multiple.gif" />
                    <p>Here are a few examples of some phases!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br />
            <hr />

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <div style="overflow: hidden">
                <div style="float: right; padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px;" class="gifContainer">
                    <img class="gif" src="assets/tritris.gif" />
                    <p>A Tritris is scored!</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Tritris, clearing 4 lines at a time is not possible, so
                    the highest score score value is gotten from 3 lines at a
                    time, a Tritris. This can only be achieved by settings up 3
                    rows, each missing half a triangle, then placing a single
                    triangle in each row. Once all triangles are placed, the
                    rows clear and a Tritris is scored!
                    <br />
                    A triple is equivalent to a Tetris in NES Tetris, a double
                    is equivalent to a triple, and a single is equivalent to a
                    double.
