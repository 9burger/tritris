                Welcome to Tritris!
                <br />
                Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press down to soft
                drop. Use Z and X to rotate. The mechanics are very similar to
                NES Tetris. It uses the same DAS, entry delay, and level speed
                timings.
                <br /><br />
                I need your help! The game is too difficult. It is almost
                impossible to complete a line. Please let me know your ideas to
                make the game easier. I am thinking I need to allow lines to be
                cleared with only one triangle per cell, as a different method
                for scoring. I am trying to keep Tetris rules in place as much
                as possible, however, I need to make the game more beatable. I
                have not yet implemented line clearing.
                <br /><br />
                I appreciate any and all input!
            </p>

            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 12pt">
                Pieces obey the same rules as NES tetris. As long as the next
                position it moves to is a valid position, it will move there.
                This means that pieces can pass through a single triangle, as
                long as the final position lines up. This is similar to spins in
                NES tetris, even though physically spinning the piece would be
                impossible, the game still allows it to spin because the final
                position is valid.
                <br /><br />
                It takes a while to get used to the new piece possibilities!
